## Overview
  The goal for this analysis is to provide W. Avy with insight into the weather patterns of a specific location on Oahu where we are proposing a new shop.
We will be visiualizing the data from SQlite to look at the temperatures in the area.

  W. Avy wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.


## Results
The deliverables for the analysisn for June and December are below. Lets go over 3 differences in the data that is 6 months apart.

  -The low temperature: The lowest tempuratures recorded were 64 degrees for June and 56 degrees for December. This is a difference of 8 degrees for the lows. 
  
  -The max temperature: The highest tempuratures recorded were 85 degrees for June and 83 degrees for December. This is only a difference of 2 degrees for the highs.
  
  -The average temperature: The average tempurature for June was 75 degrees and December was 71 degrees.

## Summary
I went ahead and pulled the same deliverables for March and September so we would have the same data points for each quarter. From this I gathered that the highest tempurature was observed in September for both the highest tempurature and the the highest average at 87 degrees. March is around the same as Decmber with the lowest tempurature being 56 degrees and high of 82 degrees with an avearge temp of 70.

In addition to the tempurate for 4 months I included the percipitation amounts for June and December to the weather. According to the images below, it rains more in Decmeber than it does in the summer months. Even though there is a high of perciptitation of 6 in December and a high of 4 in June it is still relatively low since the average rain is .1 & .2.
