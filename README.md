# surfs_up


Remember, your goal is to provide W. Avy with insight into the weather patterns of a specific location on Oahu where you would like to build your shop. One way to provide this insight is with a visualizationâ€”we'll plot the results of our precipitation analysis using Matplotlib.

W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report. You will submit the following:

Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)
